   - Provide a brief explanation of your choice of model, the training process, and the results.

### Report Submission Instructions

1. **Document Report**
   - Prepare a comprehensive report documenting your analysis, including:
     - An introduction explaining the objective of the analysis
     - A detailed explanation of the metrics created
     - A summary of the insights gained from the visualizations
     - (Optional) Explanation of the machine learning model, training process, and results
     - Conclusion with key findings and recommendations for business reporting

2. **Report Format**
   - Submit the report in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook format
   - Include relevant charts and graphs within the report
   - Ensure that the document is well-organized, with clear headings and subheadings

## Task 2: Database Schema Analysis and Query Writing

### Data Sources

- Database Schema: [Schema Diagram](media/schema.png)
- Data: [Sample Data](data/Task-2/)

### Instructions

- Analyze the provided database schema
- Write multiple SQL queries that would help in creating the required analysis metrics for dashboard creation
- Submit your queries in a .sql file or PDF format
- Note: Queries will be evaluated on our side (on the database)

### Database Notes

- Data for the full schema might not be available. Use the provided data as a reference and assume dummy data for missing information.
- For the DateID column, consider only the FullDate from the dim_date table provided in the schema.

## Important Metrics (for both tasks)

Consider including the following metrics in your analysis:

- Cost per Square Foot
- Project Type distribution
- Flat booking status percentage (over the years or location-wise)
- Return on investment of projects (Project Profit)

## Submission Guidelines

- **Deadline**: Complete and submit the task within **one week** from the date of receipt.
- **Submission Method**: Submit the report along with any visualization files to [submission email/contact].
- **Identification**: Ensure that your submission includes your name and contact information.

## Selection Process

Based on the submitted tasks, shortlisted candidates will be invited for interviews.

We look forward to reviewing your submissions and wish you the best of luck!
